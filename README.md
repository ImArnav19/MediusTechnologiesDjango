**Django File Upload and Summary Generation - Documentation**
Project Overview
This project involves developing a Django web application that allows users to upload an Excel/CSV file, processes the file to generate a summary report, and emails the summary. The summary is also displayed on a web page with a professional design using Bootstrap.

Project Structure
Forms
forms.py: Defines a form for file upload.
Views
views.py: Contains the logic for handling file uploads, processing the data, generating the summary, and sending the email.
Templates
upload.html: A simple form for uploading files.
summary.html: Displays the summary of the uploaded data in a Bootstrap-styled table.
Static Files
Bootstrap CSS: Used for styling the pages and tables.
Steps to Complete the Task
1. Web Page Creation
File Upload Form:
Created a Django form in forms.py to allow users to upload an Excel or CSV file.
The form is rendered in the upload.html template with a simple and user-friendly interface using Bootstrap.
2. Data Processing
File Handling:

The uploaded file is processed in the upload_file view located in views.py.
The file is read into a pandas DataFrame using pd.read_excel() for Excel files or pd.read_csv() for CSV files.
Data Transformation:

Grouped the data by Cust Pin and counted the occurrences of each unique Cust Pin.
Assigned the corresponding Cust State to each Cust Pin.
Reordered the columns in the DataFrame to display Cust State, Cust Pin, and the count (DPD(Count of Cust Pin)).
3. Summary Display
Bootstrap Table:
Converted the processed DataFrame to HTML using summary_df.to_html(index=False).
Rendered the summary in a Bootstrap-styled table within the summary.html template, ensuring it stretches evenly across the container.
4. Email Functionality
Email Summary:
Configured Djangoâ€™s email backend in settings.py to use SMTP (e.g., Gmail).
Sent the summary report via email with the subject "Python Assignment - Arnav More" to the specified recipient using the send_summary_email function.
5. Deployment
GIT:
Created a branch named Arnav-More and pushed the code to the repository.
Deployment:
Deployed the Django application to an open-source server (e.g., Heroku) and provided a live URL for testing.
